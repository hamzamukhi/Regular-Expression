# Regular-Expression
Regular expressions are a special "language" for denoting patterns that we want to match to strings. When used appropriately, they are a very powerful feature of Java and other programming languages. Using the Java regular expression API, we can perform tasks such as the following in just one or two lines of code:
•	string matching and validation: determining that a given string matches a particular pattern, e.g. that it is a correctly formatted telephone number or e-mail address;
•	matching with variable criteria such as case-sensitive vs case-insensitive matching;
•	substring matching or searching for instances of a particular substring within a larger string;
•	data extraction: finding an automatically extracting substrings with a particular format from a given string (e.g. the country code, dialling prefix and local telephone number from a fully specificed phone number);
•	Find and replace operations, including cases where the replacement string varies depending on the string that was found.

As well as avoiding sprawling lines of code, using the regular expression API to perform these tasks can also bring us efficiency optimisations that we might not have considered were we to write the equivalent code from scratch. As we shall see, this succinctness does sometimes come at the price of readability
